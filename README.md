TTT_ClientApp
=============

To run the app:
FIRST click the 'register' button. This provides no visual feedback (and would be automated ideally),
but the client has now been assigned a userID
NEXT click the Start button. This tells the server you want to start a game.
When two players are connected, the second player may make a move.
Both players must manually push the UPDATE button to see changes (including their own actions)
(idially, it would run perioudically).
When the game ends, neither player may make moves, and both must start new games via the Start button.
